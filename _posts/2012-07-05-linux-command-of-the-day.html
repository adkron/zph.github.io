<p>No fancy commands today, just good ol' functional admin action. I was setting up a couple of new Virtual Private Servers (ala EC2 or <a href="www.damnvps.com">DamnVPS</a>) and came across the following helpful command [cc&#95;bash]ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id&#95;rsa.pub username@remote&#95;server&#95;ip&#95;or&#95;domain[/cc_bash] What it does is copies (appends) your ssh key to the list of permissible keys on the remote server.</p>

<p>Need to make an SSH key for this purpose? [cc&#95;bash]ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096[/cc&#95;bash]</p>

<p>Need to install ssh-copy-id on OSX? [cc&#95;bash]brew install ssh-copy-id[/cc&#95;bash]</p>
