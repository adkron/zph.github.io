Noticed this today when checking my Google Analytics.... seems Civet blog is showing up from people searching for OpenEMR info.

There's a nice project available for anyone who would like to try out the OpenEMR system.  One of the project team members keeps an up to date virtual appliance ready to run in VMWare (or presumably imported and used in VirtualBox also).

Nice way to try things out before implementing your own installation.

Note: for security reasons it isn't advisable to run the virtual appliance as a true deployment.  It's easy to safely and securely deploy this via my previous blog post that describes the simple steps for installation in Debian/Ubuntu.
