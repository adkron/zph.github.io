    our society.\r\n\r\nHere's what we have right now:\r\n\r\nPrivilege\r\n: advantage,
    benefit; prerogative, entitlement, right; concession, freedom, liberty.\r\n\r\nAdvantage,
    benefit, freedom, liberty: those are all accurate words for what I disproportionately
    enjoy with being a privileged member of American society.  In fact, I've got just
    about all of the social advantages that one could ask for with being white, male,
    able bodied and a few other choice characteristics. I rolled mostly 20 in this
    attempt at life.  Because of my family's assistance and scholarships, I also had
    the advantage of completing my Bachelor's Degree.  Did I mention that my parents
    both had college degrees or better when I was young?\r\n\r\n## Where this puts
    me in life according to statistics:\r\n\r\nAccording to [US Census](http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0104552.html)
    data from 2010 median income varies significantly along ethnic lines:\r\n\r\n*
    White = $54k\r\n* Black = $32k\r\n* Hispanic = $37k\r\n\r\nAccording to [US Census](https://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0703.xls)
    data from 2009 that compares income of full time workers based on education and
    sex for my age:\r\n\r\n* Male = $67k\r\n* Female = $52k\r\n\r\nHow about the fact
    that during my childhood, I had one parent with a professional degree and one
    with a bachelor's degree?\r\n\r\n![Poverty Based on Parent's Education]( http://www.nccp.org/publications/images/pei07_fig1.jpg
    )\r\n\r\nTo summarize, statistics indicate that I earn $1.69 for every $1 that
    a black person will earn, $1.29 for every $1 that a woman earns, and my odds of
    being a child in poverty were ~ 1/4 that of a child raised by parents without
    a high school diploma.  This is purely a function of my genetic and socio-economic
    background not about any shred of my own accomplishments.  It bears repeating
    that the fact that I have an advantage in earning power as outlined in this paragraph
    has nothing to do with my own merit.\r\n\r\nWant to argue these statistics?  A
    study found that transgender women earned 32% less on average following their
    transition from male to female! [Source](http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1847194,00.html)\r\n\r\nI've
    faced some challenges in life, but they're a lot easier to overcome when playing
    with a stacked deck.\r\n\r\n## I'm Privileged So...\r\n\r\nI'm introspective enough
    to admit that I haven't always been as aware of my advantages as I am now.  Being
    a few decades into life, living meagerly for a decent chunk of my twenties, and
    traveling outside of the United States has opened my eyes.  Having friends who
    are different than myself has opened my eyes.  Listening to smart people who have
    huge hearts has also opened my eyes.  Witnessing people who live in abject poverty
    has opened my eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd this process isn't over, I'm still learning.  A
    couple of months back was my first exposure to the term 'ableism'.  I hadn't previously
    considered that calling someone 'dumb' harkenens back to this definition\r\n\r\ndumb\r\n:
    offensive (of a person) unable to speak, most typically because of congenital
    deafness: he was born deaf, dumb, and blind.\r\n\r\nOr that using the word 'insane'
    as a pejorative probably refers to individuals who suffer from schizophrenia and
    who historically faced persecution and death.\r\n\r\n## I'm still learning\r\n\r\nI'm
    proud of where I've gotten to in my approach to the world, but I want to share
    an example or two of my own past prejudices.  I share them not because I'm proud
    of my behavior, quite the contrary; I share them to show that it's a learning
    process.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in elementary school, I remember seeing another child
    on the basketball court.  In most respects, he appeared quite similar to me.  But
    his elbows and arms were covered in scaly, reddened skin that cracked and bled.
    \ I remember my revulsion and how I avoided him.\r\n\r\nI can't say that I thought
    much of that child after moving on from elementary school.  I became busy with
    school, friends, baseball and listening to music.  In high school I started having
    to deal with my own challenge in life called psoriasis.  Psoriasis is an autoimmune
    disorder where cells reproduce much faster than normal, causing intense itching
    and discomfort.  It wasn't until a few years into dealing with psoriasis that
    it dawned on me: that child who I avoided suffered from the very skin disorder
    as I did.\r\n\r\n## Join Me\r\n\r\nAs it stands now, I'm playing the game of life

    of individuals who don't have that luxury. I have better financial resilience
    to deal with social opposition as I work towards better equity in our society.\r\n\r\nIt's
    not only my choice to do this, it's also my responsibility that comes with the
    hand I was dealt. I'm going to take a stand on issues of gender equality, racial
    equality, sexual orientation equality (and more broadly the right to be yourself),
    disabled rights, bullying, and marginalizing behavior. I may not get it all right,
    but I welcome receiving feedback so that I can improve.\r\n\r\nThe next time you

    another individual:\r\n\r\n_Don't fucking let it slide_!\r\n\r\nStand up and lend
    your voice to the conversation. Your voice offsets the hatred and bigotry that
    is being leveled against someone. You'll be glad you took a stand and you're making
    this world of ours a better place."

<h1>Let's redefine privilege</h1>
Because it's not working well for our society.

Here's what we have right now:

Privilege
: advantage, benefit; prerogative, entitlement, right; concession, freedom, liberty.

Advantage, benefit, freedom, liberty: those are all accurate words for what I disproportionately enjoy with being a privileged member of society. In fact, I've got just about all of the social advantages that one could ask for with being white, male, able bodied, living in a well off country and a few other choice characteristics. I rolled mostly 20 in this attempt at life. Because of my family's assistance and scholarships, I also had the advantage of completing my Bachelor's Degree. Did I mention that my parents both had college degrees or better when I was young?
<h2>Where this puts me in life according to statistics:</h2>

I've faced some challenges in life, but they're a lot easier to overcome when playing with a stacked deck.
<h2>I'm Privileged So...</h2>
I'm introspective enough to admit that I haven't always been as aware of my advantages as I am now.

<em>Don't fucking let it slide</em>!
