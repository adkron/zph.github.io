  mkd_text: ! 'I found the delightful ''[ Marked.app ](http://markedapp.com/)'' for
    OSX recently.  It takes any Markdown file and parses it using a few standard Markdown
    interpreters, displaying a live view of the text as html.


    Of course I wanted to use it everywhere.  And by everywhere, I mean in Vim.  And
    by that I mean [@JEG2](http://www.twitter.com/jeg2) posted the idea on Twitter:

    And I ported it into a couple of lines in my .vimrc:

    Enjoy seeing your markdown render while typing in a 30+ year old text editor =D.'
