&nbsp;

OpenEMR looks like a nice way to limit physician costs as re-imbursements shrink.

Hearing lead Physician on the project, it's good stuff. Â By far the most techie talk I've attended #OhioLinuxFest

Very easy install, [ccie_bash]dpkg -i openXXXXX.deb[/ccie_bash]

Followed by an [ccie_bash] apt-get -f install [/ccie_bash] to clean up a missing dependency.

&lt; 2 min from starting wget to finishing install &amp; logging onto http://localhost/openemr.
