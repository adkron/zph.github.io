When operating on a Windows operating system I miss using GNU/Linux's Locate ... so I replace it with a combination of Launchy and Search Everything.

Search Everything indexes the names of all the files on your hard drive.  Launchy is a quick "Commandline Style" program launcher.

After installing both programs, right click on the Search Everything Start Menu entry and modify the Properties.  Replace the target properties with "C:Program Files (x86)EverythingEverything.exe" -search "

Now, right bring up the Launchy window and rebuild the catalog.

Once Search Everything has a chance to index the contents of the hard drive, you can bring up Launchy type Search {Tab} STRINGTOSEARCHFOR.

This will bring up the Search Everything window using your search term!
