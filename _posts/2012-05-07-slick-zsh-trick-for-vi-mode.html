  mkd_text: ! "Found a neat trick today for making the commandline vi-mode much more
    friendly.\n\nBack-story: As I've been spending more time programming, I find myself
    more comfortable on the commandline and in VIM.  Also, there's a setting that
    can be placed in .bashrc and/or .zshrc to allow vi style editing of the commandline.
    \ This is all well and good but without any visual indicator of whether I'm in
    INSERT MODE or NORMAL MODE... well, it's disorenting.\n\nSo the neat trick is
    to add code in your .zshrc to insert a right-hand side prompt (RPROMPT) that will
    show a notifier depending on what mode you're in.\n\nAdd the following code (and
    thank you to wherever I found this trick online)\n[cc_vim]\nfunction zle-line-init
    zle-keymap-select {\n    RPS1=\"${${KEYMAP/vicmd/--NOR--}/(main|viins)/--INS--}\"\n
    \   RPS2=$RPS1\n    zle reset-prompt\n}\nzle -N zle-line-init\nzle -N zle-keymap-select[/cc_vim]\n\nHave
    another nice trick for your .zshrc, please share it in the comments!"
