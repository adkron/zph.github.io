Setting up a friend's WP blog on a VPS Debian box. Open Book Plugin wouldn't work insisting that curl wasn't present on the system (despite [ccie_bash] apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install php5-curl [/ccie_bash] showing it's the most recent).

Loaded a php file to test if it was a recognized extension by creating a file named info.php in the web root for that site including the following code:

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Consolas, Monaco, monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre;">&lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;</span>

After pulling this document up in a browser, I deleted the file :). This pointed me in the right direction showing that the PHP.ini was deferring to /etc/php5/apache2/conf.d/curl.ini

I checked there and it was [ccie_php] extension=curl.so [/ccie_php] as expected, but obviously it wasn't being correctly located.

Did the following as root [ccie_bash] locate curl.so [/ccie_bash] and found it @ /usr/lib/php5/20090626/curl.so

Commented out the current curl.ini file for a byte trail of my actions and appended [ccie_php] extension=/usr/lib/php5/20090626/curl.so [/ccie_php]

Then a quick service apache2 restart and we were back in business.

Thanks to this blog for pointing me in the right direction: <a href="http://www.ivankristianto.com/os/ubuntu/howto-install-curl-in-php-apache/379/">http://www.ivankristianto.com/os/ubuntu/howto-install-curl-in-php-apache/379/</a>
