Migrating from a flaky VPS to a more reliable one has generally been a hassle.
But one easy part was migrating NeoRouter Server to a new Xen VPS.

[cc_bash]
tar -zcvpf OUTPUT_FILENAME.tar.gz /usr/local/ZebraNetworks/NeoRouter [/cc_bash]
Rsync or scp that file over to new VPS
[cc_bash]

wget http://download.neorouter.com/Downloads/NRPro/Update_1.6.3.3150/Linux/Ubuntu/nrclient-1.6.3.3150-pro-ubuntu-amd64.deb

sudo dpkg -i nrclient-1.6.3.3150-pro-ubuntu-amd64.deb[/cc_bash]

Decompress file into place in /usr/local... etc
Log into <a href="https://secure.neorouter.com/dashboard/default.aspx">NeoRouter dashboard</a> and redirect domain to new IP address (as found by running [cci_bash]ifconfig[/cci_bash] on NeoRouter Server VPS)
Save dashboard settings, click 'Domain Status' tab, and gloat in your success!
