<p>I've been listening to RubyRogues which introduced me to Avdi Grimm from the Ruby community.
I've also been subscribed to his RubyTapas screencast series which is a 2x a week Ruby show.</p>
<p>He uses a neat tool called rcodetools to execute Ruby code from within an Emacs buffer.  Unfortunately, it wasn't working when I tried to use the VIM counterpart, with segfault codes showing up.
Here's the fix:
( I'm using RVM to manage my Ruby Versions )
*Install Tim Pope's excellent rvm extension for VIM
  [cc_bash]
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone git://github.com/tpope/vim-rvm.git
[/cc_bash]</p>
<p>*Install rcodetools using RVM
[cc_bash]gem install rcodetools[/cc_bash]</p>
<p>*Remove keybindings in other programs (ie Dashboard &amp; Expose) for F10, F11, F12 or rebind the keys per README.vim</p>
<p>Now enter a VIM file and type F12 on any lines that you want the output from followed by F11 to evaluate the whole file.  If you want to only re-evaluate the current line use F10 instead of F11.</p>
<p>It's a great tool for terminal screencasting!  Thanks Avdi for letting me know that this tool is available.</p><!-- #VIMREPRESS_TAG# http://198.211.104.146/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/vimrepress_50cd462e_mkd.odt vimrepress_50cd462e_mkd.odt -->
