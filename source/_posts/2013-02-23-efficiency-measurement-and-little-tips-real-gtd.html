  mkd_text: "I've been working with [RescueTime](http://www.rescuetime.com) for the
    past week and I'm _VERY_ happy.\n\nFirst off, I don't have to change a thing to
    make use of the system.  It's a great way to benchmark my own time spending habits
    on the computer.  It's well setup to allow individual configuration of what _you_
    believe is productive and non-productive.\n\nDuring setup, I thought about all
    the facets of business and independent projects.  I concluded that email is a
    neutral value of productivity, while programming is +2 and reading [HackerNews](http://www.dont_go_there_it_wastes_your_live.com)
    is -2.\n\nI'm happy to share this chart for my first week of use: \n\n<!-- configurable
    section -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nif (typeof rtapi == 'undefined')
    var rtapi = {}; rtapi.kNi1 = {};\nrtapi.kNi1.title = 'All Categories ';\nrtapi.kNi1.kind
    = 'sidebar';\nrtapi.kNi1.styling = { width:300, height:300 };\n</script>\n<!--
    below is required -->\n<div id=\"rtdivkNi1\"><p id=\"rtmsg\">RescueTime: <a href=\"http://www.rescuetime.com/tour\">
    Project Time Tracking Software</a> \n&amp; Team <a href=\"http://www.rescuetime.com\">Time
    Management Software</a></p></div>\n<script src=\"https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/js/embed/B63Ni1daUFkS3NPYRbsTytaaxD4xX48hrJy4SP8n\"
    type=\"text/javascript\"></script><script type='text/javascript'>RTAPI.render_all(rtapi);</script>\n<!--
    a little how-to \n- Paste this into your web page where you want the chart.\n-
    You may have multiple embedded charts on the same page.\n- You can change the
    title, width and height by editing the named properties.\n- You can opt for the
    more verbose full chart by setting .kind to 'default'.\n- If you want your own
    css control, you can add 'rtapi.my_css = true;' before the render function.\n-
    css class names are: \n-   rtdiv : the whole container\n-   rttitle : the title,
    rtchart : the chart, rtfeed : the footer\n--> \n\n    Notice that I tagged email
    and meetings as a productivity of 0 because so little useful action comes out
    of them.  Frequently meetings would be best accomplished in short bursts and email
    involves _LOTS_ of needless repetition.\n\n    Given that email accounted for
    6 hours of my workweek, I decided to improve the efficiency of my email process.
    \ I setup my email account with OtherInbox.  OtherInbox is an email sorting service
    that does awesome things with Google Labels.\n\n    Next I added two key combinations
    for Sparrow.app.  One key combination opens a new email from ANY application while
    the other key combo brings Sparrow to forefront or hides it again.  These two
    changes have saved me lots of time so far and reduced the effort related to context
    switching.\n\n    Share your tips for email hacks and productivity (GTD) hacks!

I've been working with <a href="http://www.rescuetime.com">RescueTime</a> for the past week and I'm <em>VERY</em> happy.

First off, I don't have to change a thing to make use of the system. It's a great way to benchmark my own time spending habits on the computer. It's well setup to allow individual configuration of what <em>you</em> believe is productive and non-productive.

During setup, I thought about all the facets of business and independent projects. I concluded that email is a neutral value of productivity, while programming is +2 and reading <a href="http://www.dont_go_there_it_wastes_your_live.com">HackerNews</a> is -2.

I'm happy to share this chart for my first week of use:

Notice that I tagged email and meetings as a productivity of 0 because so little useful action comes out of them. Frequently meetings would be best accomplished in short bursts and email involves _LOTS_ of needless repetition.
