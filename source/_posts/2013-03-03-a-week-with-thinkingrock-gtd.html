    ##The Good
    My first week with ThinkingRock has gone REALLY well for adding tasks.  I sit at the computer for much of the day and when a GTD task comes to mind I dump it via `Cmd-Space GTD "description of task"<ENTER>`.

    ##The Bad
    Having a very efficient system for adding tasks paired with a _HORRIBLY_ inefficient method of processing tasks causes my GTD Inbox to overflow.

    _It's like having a firehose flowing at full strength and routing it into a gardenhose._

    ##The Analysis
    The method that I'm using for adding tasks is very well optimized and uses a decoupled system.  Being able to send emails from any device and having the subject and content dropped into ThinkingRock as a pending task is _GREAT_.

    When I go to sort the tasks, I'm stuck with a system that very literally follows GTD principles, but doesn't have sufficient keyboard shortcuts.  Processing 35 items by tabbing through textboxes and radio boxes isn't my idea of an efficient system.  It also makes me wonder if other people are painstakingly mousing through the interface.

    ##The Answer
    Dig into the source files for ThinkingRock and add enough keyboard shortcuts to "get things done".  I started this yesterday on the plane to California and I'll post back when I have a chance to work on it more.  Given that I don't know any Java (other than a session at the LeanDog CodeRetreat with [Steve](http://www.twitter.com/stevejxsn)), this will be an interesting challenge :).
