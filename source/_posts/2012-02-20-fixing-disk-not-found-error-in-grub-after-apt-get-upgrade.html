One of my development virtual machines went belly up after a recent system upgrade.

After tinkering around at the grub&gt; prompt to no avail, I booted a LiveCD, followed the instructions here: <a href="http://sazeit.com/articles/repair-or-reinstall-grub-with-boot-repair">http://sazeit.com/articles/repair-or-reinstall-grub-with-boot-repair</a>, and was up and running in minutes.

Moral of the story; sometimes it's more important to solve the problem than understand the underlying issues...not often, but sometimes :).
