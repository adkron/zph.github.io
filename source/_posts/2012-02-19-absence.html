Dear spammers,

You'll be relieved to know that i am planning to get back to blogging more.Â  Thus you'll have fresh tech posts where you can vainly attempt to post about Viagra and knockoff phones.

Ps, to human readers... I've been very busy with work and getting up to speed on web scraping, ruby, active record & sqlite3, Sinatra, and GIS. It's an exciting time but a it mellows I'll get back to blogging.
