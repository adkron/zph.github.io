<p>Very handy for quickly swapping between prior file and current file in VIM:</p>
<p>Add the following to VIMRC:
[cc_vim]nnoremap <Leader>, :b#<CR>[/cc_vim]</p>
<p>My current leader key is set to comma (,) so punching ,, switches between prior and current file, or back again.</p>
<p>Runner up for other good one liners:
[cc_vim]inoremap jk <ESC>[/cc_vim] 
This one allows you to stay on the commandline and ESCAPE out of insert mode by using key combo 'jk'!Note: I find this faster than a more common binding of 'jj' for this purpose.  With jj the same finger needs to activate the key in quick succession.  With j &amp; k the right hand index and middle finger both activate at a similar time. Thus my preference goes to the slightly easier and faster option.</p>
