[cc_bash]#shutdown now -h[/cc_bash]
Pretty important but didn't know about the '-h' flag until today. When run as root this will shutdown system (Linux specific) now and send it to a init-level 0, ie a full halt.

Good to know =D.

As pointed out in comments 'shutdown -p now' is the BSD equivalent.
