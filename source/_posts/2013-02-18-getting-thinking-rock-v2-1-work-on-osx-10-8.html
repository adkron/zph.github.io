    So, PRODUCTIVITY, GTD, BUZZWORDS HERE.

    I've used ThinkingRock before when on a GTD kick a few years back.  I liked how strictly it followed GTD.  I liked being able to email myself thoughts to act on later, since email is the universal currency.  I liked the tickle feature.

    I'm certainly willing to pay for software, as evidenced even by my donations to VIM, but I like the flexibility that's available with open source software.

    The older version, v2.1, of ThinkingRock is available on SourceForge along with the source files.  Given that I know zero Java, I thought it would be fun to have the source available for any program that I'm regularly using.

    So that leaves me with installing v2.1 on OSX 10.8 rather than the newer version.  Unfortunately, while the newer version installs quite nicely and opens as you'd expect, v2.1 throws an error [cc_bash]unable to locate jdkhome, use --jdkhome switch[/cc_bash].

    I Googled around and found this [ explanation of the JDK location  ]( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6614380/jdk-on-osx-10-7-lion ) and combined it with this [explanation](http://www.microchip.com/forums/m668597.aspx) in order to come up with the following solution: hard code the `bin/tr` shell script to include the appropriate jdkhome location.

    Here's the modified file:

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/zph/4975686.js"></script>

    Now on to revive my 3 year old GTD files, do some major deleting, get email dumps setup, and Get Things Done.
