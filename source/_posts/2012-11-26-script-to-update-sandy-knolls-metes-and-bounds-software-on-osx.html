After frequently finding myself not using the current version of Metes and Bounds, I wrote a Ruby script to automagically do that very thing. Â It checks current version, downloads the current version, and installs it into /Applications (BEWARNED, it nukes your current version of Metes and Bounds.app, use at your own risk):

Thanks to <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/12/30/daily-mac-app-flashmount-quickly-mounts-disk-images/">this random blog</a> for the hint on mounting DMGs from commandline!
