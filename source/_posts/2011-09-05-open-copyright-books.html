Found these yesterday:
<a title="http://www.computer-books.us/" href="http://www.computer-books.us/" target="_blank">http://www.computer-books.us/</a>

Some good stuff, especially traditional programming languages like Assembly and C/C++. Be sure to check the files for viruses.

Some of the books are in HTML documents which can be converted to EPUB for universal reading by using Sybil (Google Code Project)
