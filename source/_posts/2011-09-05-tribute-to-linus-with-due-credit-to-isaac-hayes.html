Theme for Linus

Who's the Swedish GPL hacker
That's a procedural coding machine to all the *nixes?
Linus, ya, damn right!

Who is the kernel master who would risk his Freax
For all the n00bs?
Linus, can you dig it?

Who's the dude that won't sell out
When there's proprietary all about?
Linus, right on.

They say this cat Shaft is a bad mother
Shut your mouth
I'm talkin' 'bout Linus
Then we can digg it
