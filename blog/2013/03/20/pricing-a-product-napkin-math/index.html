	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name">Pricing a Product: Napkin Math</h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">I&#8217;m facing the novel prospect of pricing a software product. This product is something that I created during evenings and weekends. It&#8217;s very specialized for my current industry, so I won&#8217;t go into the details of the product. But suffice to say that it sorts data in a time saving way.
<h2>Product Benefits</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Saves 1 to 10 + hours per assignment</li>
	<li>Each hour saved is worth ~ $30 +</li>
	<li>Each team member has their own assignment</li>
	<li>5 to 10 assignments submitted each week</li>
	<li>Concept can be applied for other divisions, requiring 60% retooling of the application.</li>
	<li>Providing difficult to find answers which could avoid legal fees and fines ranging from $10,000 to $1,000,000 or more.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Product Costs</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Developer&#8217;s time, my own = Approximately 240 hours.</li>
	<li>Ongoing maintenance time = 0.5 hr / wk.</li>
	<li>Monthly hosting cost = Variable based on capacity but definately &lt; $50 / month</li>
	<li>Equipment, utilities, etc during development = Not factored into estimates.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Additional Factors</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Charging for the creativity that provided the impetus.</li>
	<li>Specialized industry knowledge = Priceless :)</li>
</ul>
<h3>What&#8217;s my thought process?</h3>
My first thought was to give it away as a way to parlay into a different technical role in my organization. Like a good dealer, the first custom software taste is free, but the rest will &#8220;cost ya&#8221;.

Given further information about pricing dynamics and company response to innovation, this is not seeming to be as appealing a prospect as previously thought.
<h3>Cost based pricing</h3>
Charge a sum based on the hours invested plus a bit of padding. This is the natural method that comes to mind when I consider pricing. According to RubyFreelancer Podcast, this is the <em>Retail</em> method of pricing. They also explain at length that this is a shortsighted method of pricing a product. The short explanation is that this ties your income to an hourly wage. One can certainly make a solid income off of these numbers. But it&#8217;s difficult to transform a product into residual income or a grand success.
<h1>Result</h1>
240 hrs * $150 / hr = $36,000
<h3>Naive Pricing</h3>
Price the product at an arbitrary value, such as $5,000. This one is also tempting. This approach seems to reflect &#8216;Imposter Syndrome&#8217;. Pricing arbitrarily doesn&#8217;t tie the product&#8217;s price to the benefits and savings received by the purchasing organization. Based on the business books and sales books that I&#8217;ve read in the last year, this isn&#8217;t a likely method for sales success.
<h3>Value/Savings Based Pricing</h3>
Price the product so that purchaser saves money by using it.
10 assignments/wk * 2 hr savings/assignment * $30 savings/hr = $600/wk savings
+ Improved chance of avoiding legal fees
+ Providing more accurate information to company&#8217;s client, leading to increased client retention. (Would cost $12M+ to lose a client)
= $50k to 100k

Savings if my system is implemented beyond our regional office (ie statewide) = ~$6,000/wk on speeding up completion of assignments. This value doesn&#8217;t factor in avoiding legal fees or improved client retention.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
My plan to learn more about business and sales is already changing the way that I approach the process of selling my product. I&#8217;m moving towards value based pricing and considering how to turn the product into a residual income stream. It&#8217;s a very exciting time!

Note: Just for the record - I intend to retain Intellectual Property rights given that it&#8217;s my own work product in off-hours.
